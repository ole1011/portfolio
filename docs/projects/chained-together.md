# ðŸ”— Chained Together

Chained Together is a Minecraft plugin that introduces a unique cooperative twist by linking players together with a virtual chain. Developed as a trial project for Cytooxien, it challenges players to work together, making every move a coordinated effort.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was developed in collaboration with my good friend [ImGxrke](https://github.com/ImGxrke).

## Purpose

This project implements a chain system designed to recreate the game 'Chained Together' in Minecraft. By connecting players, the plugin fosters teamwork and strategy, requiring cooperation to navigate the game effectively.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ole1011/chained-together.git
   ```
2. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```
3. **Deploy the Plugin:**
    - Copy the generated JAR file from the `build/libs` directory to your server's plugin folder.
4. **Start Your Server:**
    - Launch the server to load the plugin.

## Usage

- **Invite a Player:**
  Right-click a player to send an invitation. They can accept by right-clicking you back.
- **Select Difficulty:**
  After acceptance, the invitor chooses a difficulty level. The selected difficulty determines the chain's length.
- **Move Together:**
  Players can pull their partner toward them using the offhand key (default: F).
- **Disband the Chain:**
  Sneak and right-click your partner to break the chain.
